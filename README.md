# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on sentiment analysis of tweets using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Sentiment analysis involves classifying the sentiment expressed in text data, such as tweets, as positive, negative, or neutral. The purpose of this project is to analyze public opinion, emotions, and attitudes reflected in Twitter data, providing insights into trends, sentiment trends, and user sentiments regarding specific topics or events.

The project utilizes machine learning algorithms, such as TF-IDF vectorization and Random Forest Classifier or Logistic Regression, to process text data and predict sentiment labels. It involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation to achieve accurate sentiment classification. The final application allows users to input tweets and receive predictions about the sentiment conveyed in those tweets, aiding in understanding public sentiment on various topics.

By analyzing Twitter sentiments, this project aims to facilitate sentiment-based decision-making, social media monitoring, brand perception analysis, and trend analysis, benefiting businesses, researchers, and individuals interested in understanding and interpreting public opinion on Twitter.
